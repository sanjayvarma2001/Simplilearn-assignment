# Executive Roundtable: The Skills That Matter Next

A High-Performance Event Landing Page for the AI Era
This project is a high-fidelity, responsive landing page built for an exclusive executive event. It bridges the gap between sophisticated design and functional engineering, utilizing Next.js 15, Server Actions, and Airtable for a seamless RSVP experience.

# The Objective

The goal was to create an invite-only feel for a leadership roundtable. Beyond the UI, the technical focus was on performance, accessibility, and a "zero-client-side-logic" approach to form handling, ensuring data security and speed.

# The Tech Stack

Framework: Next.js (App Router)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Customized for high-scale typography and fluid spacing)

Database/Backend: Airtable (Managed via Server Actions)

Deployment: Vercel

# Key Features

1. Modern Server-Side Architecture
   I utilized Next.js Server Actions to handle RSVP submissions. This eliminates the need for a traditional API route, reduces the JavaScript bundle size on the client, and keeps the Airtable credentials securely on the server.

2. "Mobile-First" Responsive Design
   Every section—from the Hero background focus to the Agenda cards—was designed to be fluid.

Agenda Section: Uses a CSS Grid that elegantly stacks from 3 columns on desktop to a single column on mobile.

Checkmate Section: Implements flex-col-reverse to ensure high-impact imagery appears at the top on small screens while maintaining a side-by-side layout on desktop.

3. Interactive UX with Feedback
   Using the useActionState and useFormStatus hooks, the RSVP form provides real-time feedback. Users see a "Sending..." state during submission and a clear success/error message upon completion without the page refreshing.

# Local Setup

## Clone the repo:

    Bash

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

## Install dependencies:

    Bash

    npm install

## Configure Environment Variables: Create a .env.local file and add:

    Code snippet

    AIRTABLE_PAT=your_token
    AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your_base_id
    AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=your_table_name

## Run the development server:

    Bash
    npm run dev

# Implementation Notes

During development, I prioritized Layout Stability. By avoiding hardcoded pixel heights and using Flexbox/Grid alignment, I ensured that the text content never overlaps, even if the user has a different default font size or a narrower mobile screen.
